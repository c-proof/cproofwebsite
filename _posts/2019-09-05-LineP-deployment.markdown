On July 19th 2019, C-PROOF launched two gliders, `dfo-eva035` and `dfo-walle652`, about 400 km offshore in the Pacific Ocean, near Explorer Seamount. Technician James Pegg lead the deployment effort aboard the *CCGS Tully*, helped by the C-PROOF team at home.  `dfo-eva035` was being tested, and was successfully recovered after a 108-h mission.  `dfo-walle652` was working well, and outfitted with long-range batteries, so is off to Station Papa, 800 km to the west-northwest.   Once getting there, Walle will turn around and head back along Line P, collecting valuable oceanographic data along the path.

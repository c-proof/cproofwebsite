On May 7th 2022, C-PROOF launched our glider `dfo-bb046` (BB) in Queen Charlotte Sound, near Calvert Island. Our partners at the Hakai Institute deployed the glider, with the C-PROOF team piloting remotely.  `dfo-bb046` previously occupied our Calvert Line for almost a full year, and we are excited to see the glider back in the water again!  BB had to take a break from sampling due to a corroded oxygen sensor, which was replaced by DFO. BB will be doing a series of missions out past the shelf break about 150 km to the west and back again.   BB flies through a submarine trough that crosses the continental shelf, almost like an underwater riverbed, collecting valuable oceanographic data between the ocean's surface and the seafloor.  

Follow along and see the plots of the data on the live C-PROOF mission webpage [here](https://cproof.uvic.ca/gliderdata/deployments/dfo-bb046/dfo-bb046-20220507/).

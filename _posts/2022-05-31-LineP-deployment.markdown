On May 31st 2022, C-PROOF launched our glider `dfo-rosie713` (Rosie) near Tofino. Big thanks to the crew of the CCGS Cape Kuper for deploying the glider. Rosie is flying along Line P in the Northeast Pacific Ocean, heading towards Ocean Station Papa. This mission is critical, because the regular spring DFO research cruise had to be cancelled this year, making Rosie's data extra valuable to maintaining an ongoing record along this historic ocean sampling line.
Rosie will be travelling 3000 km before arriving back at Vancouver Island a few months from now.  

Follow along and see the plots of the data on the live C-PROOF mission webpage [here](https://cproof.uvic.ca/gliderdata/deployments/dfo-rosie713/dfo-rosie713-20220531/).

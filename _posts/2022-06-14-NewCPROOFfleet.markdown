The C-PROOF ocean glider fleet just doubled in size. From June 14th to 16th, 2022, 
we successfully tested our five new Slocum G3 gliders with the assistance of representatives 
from Teledyne Webb Research. These new gliders are equipped with rechargeable battery packs, 
and three of them are extended gliders, which means they can fly further and do more before they need 
to be recharged. 

As is C-PROOF tradition, the new gliders are all named after famous robots: 

Maria-997

Bumblebee-998

K-999

Hal-1002

Marvin-1003

We're excited to both continue our current operations on Line P and on the Calvert Line, while 
also increasing the number of glider lines we are able to occupy year-round. The data we collect 
will provide invaluable information about BC coastal waters and the Northeast Pacific Ocean.

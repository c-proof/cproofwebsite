We deployed our first glider off of Haida Gwaii last week!

Marvin was deployed from DFO's Sharing Science at Sea Expedition in collaboration with the Council of Haida Nation and Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site. Before being launched, Marvin participated in classroom tours of the ship, illustrating what gliders are and what they can do.

After launch, Marvin traveled down the coast of these remote islands, collecting valuable baseline oceanographic information on two proposed marine protected areas adjacent to Gwaii Haanas and along the upcoming SWOT altimetry track.

Marvin's path is shown with a thick yellow line, the typical QCS glider paths are shown with thin lines (multicolored), the SWOT swaths are shown with white shading and the proposed MPA are shown with green and pink shadings.")

In the next day or so, Marvin will turn into Queen Charlotte Sound and complete the QCS glider monitoring line before being picked up by Hakai Research Institute scientists.

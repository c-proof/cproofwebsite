The same research cruise that deployed Marvin, also deployed one of the Argo Canada floats that C-PROOF transformed into a BGC-Argo float by adding an oxygen sensor. Like his cousin Marvin, this Argo float participated in science outreach and virtual ship tours as part of DFO's Sharing Science at Sea Expedition before being deployed off of Haida Gwaii.

The float has been collecting data off the coast of Gwaii Haanas (4 profiles to 2000 meters below the sea surface so far) and hasn't travelled far from the deployment location inside one of the proposed marine protected areas. To help with follow-on outreach activities by the Council of the Haida Nation and Gwaii Haanas scientists, this float has also been officially designated as adopted by the Council of Haida Nation in the Adopt-a-Float program.
